# Justice for Fakelandia

## Introduction

The faraway country of Fakelandia has decided to modernise their justice system with a fancy new technology: "websites".

Fakelandia is a happy place with a low crime rate, but it's important to each citizen that justice is seen to be served, so they'd like a website to keep abreast of the latest justice developments - and they've specifically asked for YOU to help out.

Remember the importance of:

* Writing tests for your components
* Using BEM to write scalable, reusable CSS
* Keeping your components small and refactoring them into sub-components where necessary
* Using hooks to store state, make API calls, and pass data down to sub-components through contexts

## Crimes and Misdemeanours

The Fakelandians have asked for a site that lets them browse lists of crimes committed today, and also for functionality that helps citizens confess to their own crimes. 

As a non-citizen, you might not be aware that there are only four possible crimes in Fakelandia:

* Mild Public Rudeness
* Speaking in a Lift
* Not Eating Your Vegetables
* Supporting Manchester United

Despite the clear severity of some of these awful crimes, the Fakelandians refer to them all as "misdemeanours".

## Creating your application

To create your application, run the following command in an empty folder:

```
npx create-react-app . --template typescript 
```

This will setup a fresh React app for you, with everything for TypeScript already enabled.

Followed by:

```
npm start & npm test
```

You should then be able to access the default application by opening the browser and visiting

[http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000)

## Let's get started

Time to start building the app the Fakelandians want. Let's start with the homepage in [activity 1](./docs/activity_1.md).
